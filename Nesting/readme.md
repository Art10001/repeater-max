# Intention Repeater Nesting Files

By Anthro Teacher

These files are optional, but they will amplify how powerful the Repeater is with each iteration.

If you use the full NEST stack (i.e. all the NEST files), it will essentially repeat a googol times for each iteration of your chosen file.

INTENTIONS.TXT = All your intentions in one file. It must be named INTENTIONS.TXT.

MYNEST.TXT = Can be any name. This connects to the top of the NEST stack, to ensure you run the full thing.

Run INTENTIONS.TXT to repeat your intentions once per iteration.

Run MYNEST.TXT to repeat your intentions a googol times per iteration.

It's amazing that all these files are only 412kB in size.

You can set the power level (1-100) by replacing the NEST- files in MYNEST.TXT with your desired level.

For instance, replace "NEST-100.TXT" in MYNEST.TXT with "NEST-50.TXT" to lower to power level 50.
