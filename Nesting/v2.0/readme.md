# Intention Repeater Nesting File Creation Utility v2.0

Created by Anthro Teacher 5/22/2021.

This utility converts # of files, and intentions per file, into a Nested File Structure.

It can also create a .zip archive on the fly.

Use: Repeater_Nesting_Utility_Win64.exe and follow the prompts.

NEST-FULLPOWER.ZIP contains 1000 NEST Files, plus a NEST-0.TXT (which references INTENTIONS.TXT).

It has 10,000 repetitions in each file.

This is 1000 ^ 10000 total iterations. Note that a Googol is only 10 ^ 100 iterations. So this is off the scale.

This utility can create a .zip archive on the fly named NEST-FULLPOWER.ZIP.

Just follow the prompts. There are not flags. Just run using the binary, or through compiled code.
