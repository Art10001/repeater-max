An optimized version of the Intention Repeater, written in C++.
Repeats your intention up to 100+PHz.

You probably want intention_repeater_max.cpp if you are on Linux,
and intention_repeater_max.exe if you are on Windows.

I recommend using clang++ for compiling on Linux.

To compile on Linux: clang++ -O3 ./intention_repeater_max.cpp -o ./intention_repeater_max

To edit code I recommend Visual Studio Code.

To format the code, and beautify it, I recommend clang-format.

Special thanks to Karteek Sheri for providing the benchmarking and performance enhancement.

Special thanks to Mystic Minds for creating the Holo-Link framework that is used in v4.0.
