An optimized version of the Intention Repeater, written in C++.
Repeats your intention up to 100+PHz.

You probably want intention_repeater_max.cpp if you are on Linux,
and intention_repeater_max.exe if you are on Windows.

To compile g++ is faster (by a little), but I prefer clang++ because it has a cooler name.

To compile your code: clang++ -O3 ./intention_repeater_max.cpp -o ./intention_repeater_max

Please see the Example .cpp files for the basics of Multiplying Intention in memory, and to a file.

To edit code I recommend Visual Studio Code.

To format the code, and beautify it, I recommend clang-format.

Special thanks to Karteek Sheri for providing the benchmarking and performance enhancement.
